I will add this AND clarify that you ethically source data.  Opt in vs Opt out data collection and a zero tolerance for child abuse is a no-brainer.  In 2024 let's remember the lessons of #vc hyper-growth promises of utopia, it is always a lie that pushes #negativeexternalities.

One thing of 2023 will stay true in 2024: the fastest way to get wide visibility and catch-up the current AI boom will be to open-source a good model

So came most of 2023’s surprises and it will continue to hold both for startups and much larger companies reinventing themselves

Idea for the day: Build an AI-driven platform that allows a user to select any song, and then create a version of it being sung by the user's favorite singer.  This can be done manually right now, so it wouldn't be a big stretch to create a platform that puts the pieces together. The tricky thing would probably be with the legalities more than the technical challenges involved.  Do you think this could be a startup?
