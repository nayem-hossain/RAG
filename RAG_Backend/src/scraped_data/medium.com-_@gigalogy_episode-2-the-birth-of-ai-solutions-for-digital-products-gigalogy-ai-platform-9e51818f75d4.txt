In the second episode of my journey, I found myself pondering a groundbreaking idea as a product manager. Back in 2017, the potential of AI had not yet permeated the mainstream, and only a few players were exploring its possibilities. It was during this time that I had a revelation that could revolutionize how businesses interacted with their customers.
The thought was simple yet powerful:
“If we can create promotions specialized for each user, can’t we improve conversion rates and increase sales?”
I saw the potential of AI in transforming the way businesses engaged with their customers, personalizing experiences, and driving success.
At the time, my company was substantial, boasting over 5,000 employees and offices across the world. Surprisingly, we didn’t have a dedicated AI team. As I delved deeper into the issue, I discovered that this was a widespread challenge faced by many companies. The lack of AI development systems hindered their ability to unlock the true potential of personalized experiences.
Driven by the belief that AI solutions could be the key to unlocking this potential, I made a life-changing decision:
“Okay, let’s create a business related to AI.”
To kickstart this new venture, I recognized the importance of addressing three crucial steps:
Step 1: Clarify what challenges can be solved.
Step 2: Check if it can generate revenue and stand as a business.
Step 3: Establish superiority by differentiating from existing solutions.
At that time, AI solutions were mainly offered by software consulting firms, but I noticed a few key characteristics that set them apart. The timeline to release a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) typically took around a year, and the cost ranged from 20 million yen to 100 million yen. This high cost made it challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises or growing companies to adopt AI solutions.
Furthermore, these consulting firms primarily focused on larger enterprises, neglecting the needs of smaller companies and non-technology-focused businesses. The lack of a clear return on investment made investing in AI solutions a high-risk decision for many.
Realizing the potential to create AI solutions that catered to the needs of all businesses, from large corporations to small and medium-sized enterprises, I was inspired to establish “AI Solutions for Digital Products: Gigalogy AI Platform.” I envisioned a company that would bridge the gap and provide accessible, cost-effective, and efficient AI solutions to businesses of all sizes, enabling them to unlock the full potential of personalized experiences.
In the upcoming episodes, I’ll share the challenges, triumphs, and pivotal moments that shaped the growth of “Gigalogy AI Platform.” Join me as I continue on this exhilarating journey, determined to make a lasting impact on businesses and their customers through the power of AI.
