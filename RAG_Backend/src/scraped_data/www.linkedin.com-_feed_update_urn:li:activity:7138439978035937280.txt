We are thrilled to announce that we will be co-hosting an exclusive event with our partner, Cross Compass, Ltd., at our office on Wednesday, December 13th. 

The event will focus on the theme of "Generative AI for Manufacturing Industry."

Recently, there has been significant progress in the implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have garnered attention. 
We aim to delve into the possibilities of Gigalogy by leveraging the synergy between our in-house GPT development environment, designed for effortless tailoring of generative AI with cutting-edge language models and Cross Compass, Ltd.‚Äôs AI solutions, specifically crafted for the manufacturing sector.

ü§ù About our partnership:

Since September, we have established a pioneering partnership with Cross Compass, Ltd., focusing on delivering sophisticated machine-learning platforms and nurturing exceptional AI professionals.
Through our collaborative effort, leveraging our combined strengths, our goal is to establish a comprehensive, integrated solution for the development and practical implementation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies.

Together, we have founded the Pivotal AI Institute (PAI), an educational center committed to developing the next generation of AI professionals. Our focus is on empowering these emerging talents to pioneer and shape the standards of Artificial Intelligence adoption across diverse industries.

We are eagerly anticipating the arrival of fellow innovation enthusiasts and look forward to exchanging our visionary ideas and insights! üí°

üß† Introducing an Insightful New Paper on the Future of AI! üöÄ by two folks I respect a lot Gary Marcus and Douglas Lenat | They understand the landscape, the history of how we got here, are realists and optimists at the same time. 

Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs), is the current trend in AI. And it's not perfect ‚Äì they're often unpredictable, uninterpretable, and lack in reasoning abilities.

This groundbreaking paper lays out 16 key desires for future AI, and an alternative approach that could remedy these shortcomings:

‚úÖ Using explicit knowledge and rules
‚úÖ Enabling an inference engine for logical deductions
‚úÖ Producing trustworthy and interpretable results

However, there's a challenge:  How to make this engine fast without losing expressive logic? ü§î Enter the CYC project! It has developed ways to overcome this tradeoff, enabling real-time reasoning in higher-order logic.

The paper advocates for a hybridized approach, combining the strengths of LLMs and more formal methodologies. This new direction could be a game-changer in our journey towards more reliable and robust AI systems.

Paper: https://lnkd.in/gw-J_c8E 

üíº Explore the paper to learn more about this path to realizing the dream of trustworthy general AI!

üì£ Exciting research update! üåêüìö

Announcing a new blog post that delves into the world of AI and its impact on society. We evaluate and enhance the value judgments made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in our study, "Evaluating and Improving Value Judgments in AI: A Scenario-Based Study on Large Language Models' Depiction of Social Conventions." 

As AI technologies continue to advance, it becomes crucial to ensure that the output they produce aligns with human needs. In this research, we explore how contemporary AI services meet user expectations and delve into LLMs' depiction of social conventions. 

Findings from our query experiment, which compared LLMs' value judgments with public data, provide interesting insights. We propose a model of decision-making in value-conflicting scenarios, which may shape future machine value judgments. Our approach advocates for using AI as a tool to explore different perspectives and remote worlds.

Join us on this exciting journey towards safe and accurate value judgments in AI. Read the full blog post here: https://bit.ly/3R49yej üìñüí°

Let's empower ourselves with a critical perspective on AI and its role in shaping our environment. We hope this study inspires anyone, regardless of their capacity, to effectively receive value judgment-based outputs. #AIresearch #ValueJudgments #LLMs

My Prediction - Artificial Intelligence in 2024:

In 2024, the spotlight in the AI landscape is shifting from the ascent of Generative AI (GenAI) to a heightened focus on addressing tangible business challenges. My key predictions for the year revolve around the continued impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on technology, the metamorphosis of data teams into entities resembling software teams, and the convergence of engineering and data practices. Additionally, the rising significance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is poised to play a crucial role in enhancing AI products.

A prominent trend in 2024 will be the operationalization of enterprise-ready AI products, emphasizing the creation of valuable solutions rather than superficial integration for display purposes.
