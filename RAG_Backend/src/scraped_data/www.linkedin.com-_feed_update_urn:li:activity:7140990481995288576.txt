Just wrapped up an insightful event with our partner Cross Compass, Ltd., exploring the frontiers of "Generative AI for the Manufacturing Industry." 
Here's a glimpse into the highlights and key takeaways of yesterday's talküí°

- Navigating the GPT Bot Development Landscape: We have explored the difficulties in developing GPT bots, focusing on fine-tuning and data preprocessing, and how Gigalogy's expertise provides invaluable support in these areas. It was enlightening to see the practical solutions that Gigalogy offers for these complex processes.

- MyGPT's Dual Processing Capability: attendees discovered the advanced functionality of Gigalogy's MyGPT, which uniquely processes both image and text prompts concurrently. 
This dual capability allows MyGPT to understand and extract information from images while responding to text prompts, enhancing the depth and accuracy of its intelligence gathering and user interactions.

- Application in the Manufacturing Industry: We explored how this cutting-edge technology can be applied in the manufacturing industry, specifically to enhance quality control processes. By integrating these tools, we can significantly improve our ability to identify defects and pinpoint faulty products, thereby increasing efficiency and ensuring product reliability.

We are thankful for the presence of our fellow innovation enthusiasts who joined us yesterday evening.
Let's continue shaping the future of AI together!

Generative AI is all the hype? We agree. But we have cautiously experimented this in Fr8labs for LogTech, and are amazed by what we can achieve and what this brings to the table for forwarders in terms of Growth Potential.

Didn't have time to watch our video? In summary, with natural language voice inputs, you can instruct our platform through an external chat medium to do all sorts of actions you would typically type into your system of record (like create a quotation, booking or create a shipment) or instruct your own internal operations teams to follow up on. Imagine the force multiplier effect this can have to your teams as they now switch their focus on work that truly matters.

How do you feel about AI in freight forwarding operations - excited or apprehensive?

Hello AI Aficionados! ü§ì

We've got a buzzworthy byte-size idea that's going to flip your dataset creation process on its head! Imagine a world where you can create surrogate datasets that are representative of the full thing, yet diverse, without draining your precious computational resources. No, it's not sci-fi. It's science-fact! üòé

Through the magic of generative diffusion techniques, our boffin buddies have found a way to simplify and enhance dataset distillation. This means you get to say "Ta-ta" to the era of boring, limited datasets and "Hello" to a galaxy of data possibilities. üéâ Now, isn't that worth a celebratory robot dance? *does the robot*

Ready to revolutionise your dataset creation? Want to know what makes our byte-size world spin effortlessly? Well, allow me to leave you this tantalising breadcrumb: [Link](https://lnkd.in/guvmnezQ) ü•ñ

And remember, that's just the amuse-bouche! For the full 5-course menu of byte-size knowledge nuggets delivered piping hot from the Atometrix kitchen, hit the subscribe button at https://lnkd.in/djpHz2pf. 

Dig in, and let's cook up a data storm together!

üí´ Exciting news! I just released two new processors for MittaAI. The `jump_task` and `halt_task` node types will allow for greater control over the flow of our pipeline process. By using Jinja2, these processors can be used inside templates to control the pipeline flow. This means that an LLM can now control the pipeline flows when used with an `aidict` or `aistruct` processor.  I'll let that one sink in before talking more about it... #DAG

‚å® The next step is implementing a `call_task` processor, which will allow for a callback to be made directly to a given node in a pipeline. This will enable nodes that use callbacks internally (such as required in some AI services) to callback to the next node in the pipeline, allowing it to continue processing the same job without having to use separate pipelines. 

üöÄ My focus on building things that get people using the product in a low friction way has led me to these new developments. As always, I strive to treat myself as the first customer and continue to build features that improve the product. Thanks to everyone who reads these and supports me! üôè  #AI #pipeline #development
