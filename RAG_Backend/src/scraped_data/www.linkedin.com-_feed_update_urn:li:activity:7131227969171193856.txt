Building #GenerativeAI products should be about reinforcing the ‘who we are’ and ‘why we exist’ in people, your customers. I’ve met many founders focused exclusively on building capabilities that focus on ‘what we do’. This is fine - only until that capability gets fast commoditized as it is usually a trained skill or behavior and can be easily replicated. Focusing on the ‘who’ and ‘why’ can unlock positive intent via lived experiences in people, which should anchor your product strategy and ultimately deliver an ethical product experience for your consumers. These anchor capabilities are also impossible to replicate by competitors, and will serve as the raison d’etre for your product through the ups-and-downs of the startup journey.

Best advice I’ve heard recently:

Extend your time horizon.

Build habits for long-term success

Don’t get caught up on issues today that won’t matter 5 years from now

But in an accelerating market…

AI startups need wins NOW

Or risk falling behind

How are you balancing your time horizon?

90% of #GenAI 'products' have no technical moat.  
 
They are simply features that can be hacked together in a week by a good Engineer. 
 
The market structure for these products will become highly competitive and there will be startup casualties along the way
